# cmsc423_f21_project3_cpp_sample

This repository provides a suffix array construction implementation in C++ you can use for Project 3. The SA construction code is the SAIS-lite implementation of Yuta Mori. You can use this 
suffix array implementation prior to your FM index implementation (but you are, of course, free and even encouraged to use your own implementation from project 2).
